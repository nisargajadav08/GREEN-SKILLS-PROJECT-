SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE WITH AI FOR CROP YIELD PREDICTION
Brief Overview:
Agriculture is highly dependent on environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and soil quality. Climate change and resource constraints make it challenging for farmers to predict crop yields accurately. Inefficient resource utilization leads to reduced productivity and financial losses. 
AI-based crop yield prediction can help optimize resource allocation and enhance sustainability in farming.


Key Objectives:
Develop a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on environmental and soil parameters.
Provide accurate insights to help farmers make data-driven decisions.
Optimize water, fertilizer, and land usage for sustainable agriculture.
Improve crop productivity while minimizing environmental impact.
